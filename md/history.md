**About Me**

Hello, my name is Jean-Baptiste Besnard. I'm a computer scientist with expertise in parallel systems, runtime, and profiling aspects.

**Early Interest in Computers**

My interest in computers dates back to my childhood. I started on an IBM PC with an 8088 processor and Windows 3.1 operating system. I was among the few who left the "Turbo button" always on - why not? At around age 10, I began programming in Quick Basic, where I discovered my fondness for blue backgrounds and learned that the PC speaker could generate unbearable noises. Later, I moved to C++ with Borland C++ IDE and developed tiny projects under Windows, including a vocal assistant leveraging the Microsoft Assistant API.

**Linux Experience**

Around 15 years old, I switched to Linux and started learning C, Bash, and system administration (with some initial system crashes). My first distribution was Mandrake, which was a French distro that came with many pre-installed packages. During this time, I experimented with various aspects of computing and developed an interest in parallel systems.

**High-Performance Computing**

I've been working extensively in the field of High-Performance Computing, specializing in parallel systems, runtime, and profiling. My experience includes developing tools for analyzing HPC applications, integrating MPI support into runtimes, and optimizing network communication (libfabric, libibverbs). I'm also familiar with compiler-side privatization techniques and have worked on RDMA support within MPC runtimes.

**Industry Experience**

In industry settings, I've been a part of various projects as a consultant or developer. My work includes implementing virtual machine orchestrators, containers, working on MPI implementations on a wide range of aspects. As the company grew, my responsibilities expanded to include management roles, communication, and research project coordination.

**Current Role**

As Technical Leader and Manager, I oversee the development of projects within our team, ensuring timely delivery and effective collaboration among team members. My expertise in parallel systems, runtime, and profiling continues to play a significant role in driving innovation and optimization in HPC environments.

**MPI Forum Working Group**

I'm also actively involved with the MPI Forum working group as part of the INRIA Bordeaux-led effort to produce valuable hardware abstractions targeting next-generation HPC architectures. As one of the founding members, I contribute to this initiative by providing insights from my experiences and research findings.
