# ADMIRE EuroHPC Project

In ADMIRE, I have actively participated in the monitoring work package. This participation led to the development of a machine-wide monitoring infrastructure that aims to tune the I/O stack in real-time using malleability techniques. Additionally, I led the dissemination work package.


Here are some deliverable demonstrating the monitoring infrastructure design:
- [D5.3 Report on the implementation of application I/O profiling](https://admire-eurohpc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/D5_3_Report_on_the_implementation_of_application_IO_Profiling.pdf);
- [D5.4 Monitoring solution at Exascale](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mx831mokb2w2tsy/D5_4_Monitoring_solution_at_exascale.pdf?dl=0);
- [D5.5 Extra-P Extended with I/O Modelling Capabilities](https://admire-eurohpc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/D5_5_admire.pdf)


This led to the development of the [metric-proxy](https://github.com/besnardjb/proxy_v2) a TBON-based aggregation tool to monitor a whole machine. This implementation was done in Rust.
