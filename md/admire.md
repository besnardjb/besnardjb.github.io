# Monitoring Infrastructure Development in ADMIRE

The ADMIRE project aimed to develop innovative monitoring solutions for high-performance computing (HPC) systems. As part of this effort, I participated in the monitoring work package, which involved designing and implementing a machine-wide monitoring infrastructure.

## My Role in the Project

As part of my role in the monitoring work package, I:

* Contributed to the design and implementation of the monitoring infrastructure
* Led the dissemination work package, ensuring that the project's findings were shared with the wider community

## Monitoring Infrastructure Design Deliverables

Here are some key deliverables showcasing the design of our monitoring infrastructure:

* [D5.3 Report on the implementation of application I/O profiling](https://admire-eurohpc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/D5_3_Report_on_the_implementation_of_application_IO_Profiling.pdf)
* [D5.4 Monitoring solution at Exascale](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mx831mokb2w2tsy/D5_4_Monitoring_solution_at_exascale.pdf?dl=0)
* [D5.5 Extra-P Extended with I/O Modelling Capabilities](https://admire-eurohpc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/D5_5_admire.pdf)

## Metric-Proxy: An aggregating Push Gateway for Prometheus

The development of our monitoring infrastructure led to the creation of [metric-proxy](https://github.com/besnardjb/proxy_v2), a Rust-based aggregation tool that utilizes TBON (Tuning Bottleneck Optimization Network) capabilities to monitor an entire machine.
